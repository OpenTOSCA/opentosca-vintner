# Policy Has No Targets

{{ autogenerated_notice('./task docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

## Description

The policy "policy_one" has no targets. Thus, the policy has no present targets and, therefore, is removed.

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
{% raw %}
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      type_default_condition: true
  policies:
    - policy_one:
        type: policy_one
        targets: []
        conditions:
          has_present_target: policy_one
{% endraw %}
```




## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
{% raw %}
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
{% endraw %}
```
