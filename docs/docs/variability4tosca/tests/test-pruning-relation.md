# Relation Pruning

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

Node "node_one" is not present. The relation "relation_two" is also not present even though assigned conditions evaluate to "true" since relation pruning is enabled.

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      relation_pruning: true
      type_default_condition: true
  node_templates:
    node_one:
      type: node_one
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - relation_two:
            node: node_two
            conditions: true
    node_two:
      type: node_two
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_two:
      type: node_two
```
