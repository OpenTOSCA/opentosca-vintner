# Relation Pruning

{{ autogenerated_notice('./task docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

## Description

Node "node_one" is not present. The relation "relation_two" is also not present even though assigned conditions evaluate to "true" since relation pruning is enabled.

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
{% raw %}
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
    variability:
        options:
            relation_pruning: true
            type_default_condition: true
            expected_incoming_relation_check: false
    node_templates:
        node_one:
            type: node_one
            conditions: false
            requirements:
                - relation_two:
                      node: node_two
                      conditions: true
        node_two:
            type: node_two
{% endraw %}
```




## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
{% raw %}
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
    node_templates:
        node_two:
            type: node_two
{% endraw %}
```
