# scenario-worker-worker-false

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

## Description

- agent and worker hosted on a virtual machine
- virtual machine is only present if either agent or worker is present
- agent is only present if the virtual machine is present, thus, circle

- worker is absent
- since pruning is enabled, all components are absent


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      mode: semantic-loose
      optimization_topology: true
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      conditions:
        host_presence: SELF
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    worker:
      type: worker
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
```




## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
```
