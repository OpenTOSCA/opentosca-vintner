## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      mode: loose
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      conditions:
        host_presence: SELF
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    worker:
      type: worker
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
```
