# Pruning Nodes (Transient)

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

- Node and relation pruning is enabled.
- Node "node_three" has two incoming relations whose sources are the node "node_one" and "node_two". 
- Node "node_one" is transient and node "node_two" is not present.
- Thus, node "node_three" is not present since only a transient node has an incoming relation.
- Node "node_four" also has incoming relations, however, is present since there had not been any incoming relation at all.


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_one:
      type: node_one
      transient: true
      requirements:
        - relation_two:
            node: node_three
            conditions: false
    node_two:
      type: node_two
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - relation_three: node_three
    node_three:
      type: node_three
    node_four:
      type: node_four
```



## Resolver Configuration

The following resolver configuration is used.

```yaml linenums="1"
enable_relation_pruning: true
enable_node_pruning: true

```

## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_four:
      type: node_four
```


## Resolver Configuration

The following resolver configuration is used.

```yaml linenums="1"
enableRelationPruning: true
enableNodePruning: true
```
