# host-pruning-transitive-preserved

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

## Description

- hypervisor is preserved in contrast to "transitive-unexpected"
- and not ambiguous as in "transitive-ambiguous"


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      mode: semantic-loose
      node_default_condition_mode: incoming-host
      hosting_stack_constraint: true
      optimization: false
      unique: true
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    worker:
      type: worker
      persisent: true
      requirements:
        - host:
            node: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
      requirements:
        - host: hypervisor
    hypervisor:
      type: hypervisor
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    worker:
      type: worker
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
      requirements:
        - host: hypervisor
    hypervisor:
      type: hypervisor
```
