## Description

- node pruning is enabled
- relation defaults (NOT pruning) is enabled

- since node_three is present, relation_three_one is present (condition is not overridden by pruning since relation pruning is not enabled)
- since relation_three_one is present, node_one is present
- since node_one is present, node_two is present, thus, relation_two_one is present


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      node_pruning: true
      relation_default_condition: true
      type_default_condition: true
  node_templates:
    node_one:
      type: node_one
    node_two:
      type: node_two
      conditions:
        node_presence: node_one
      requirements:
        - relation_two_one: node_one
    node_three:
      type: node_three
      requirements:
        - relation_three_one:
            node: node_one
            conditions:
              source_presence: SELF
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_one:
      type: node_one
    node_two:
      type: node_two
      requirements:
        - relation_two_one: node_one
    node_three:
      type: node_three
      requirements:
        - relation_three_one:
            node: node_one
```
