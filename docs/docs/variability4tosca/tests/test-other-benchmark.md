# Benchmark

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

To benchmark our implementation of a Variability4TOSCA processor, we run several tests. Thereby, a service template is generated and then resolved based on a seed. A seed of value n results in 2n node templates and 2n relationship templates, thus, 4n templates. For example, a seed of 10,000 generates 20,0000 node templates and 20,0000 relationship templates. When variability is resolved, n node templates and n relationship templates are removed.

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    inputs:
      mode:
        type: string
    expressions:
      condition_0_present:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - present
      condition_0_removed:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - absent
      condition_1_present:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - present
      condition_1_removed:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - absent
    options:
      type_default_condition: true
  node_templates:
    component_0_present:
      type: component_type_0_present
      conditions:
        logic_expression: condition_0_present
      requirements:
        - relation_present:
            node: component_1_present
            conditions:
              logic_expression: condition_0_present
            relationship: relationship_0_present
        - relation_removed:
            node: component_1_removed
            conditions:
              logic_expression: condition_0_removed
            relationship: relationship_0_removed
    component_0_removed:
      type: component_type_0_removed
      conditions:
        logic_expression: condition_0_removed
    component_1_present:
      type: component_type_1_present
      conditions:
        logic_expression: condition_1_present
      requirements:
        - relation_present:
            node: component_0_present
            conditions:
              logic_expression: condition_1_present
            relationship: relationship_1_present
        - relation_removed:
            node: component_0_removed
            conditions:
              logic_expression: condition_1_removed
            relationship: relationship_1_removed
    component_1_removed:
      type: component_type_1_removed
      conditions:
        logic_expression: condition_1_removed
  relationship_templates:
    relationship_0_present:
      type: relationship_type_0_present
    relationship_0_removed:
      type: relationship_type_0_removed
    relationship_1_present:
      type: relationship_type_1_present
    relationship_1_removed:
      type: relationship_type_1_removed
```

## Variability Inputs

When resolving variability, the following variability inputs shall be used.

```yaml linenums="1"
mode: present
```


## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    component_0_present:
      type: component_type_0_present
      requirements:
        - relation_present:
            node: component_1_present
            relationship: relationship_0_present
    component_1_present:
      type: component_type_1_present
      requirements:
        - relation_present:
            node: component_0_present
            relationship: relationship_1_present
  relationship_templates:
    relationship_0_present:
      type: relationship_type_0_present
    relationship_1_present:
      type: relationship_type_1_present
```
