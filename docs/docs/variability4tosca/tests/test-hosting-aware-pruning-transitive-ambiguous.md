## Description

- ambiguous since circle at agent


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
{% raw %}
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
    variability:
        options:
            mode: semantic-loose
            node_default_condition_mode: incoming-host
            hosting_stack_constraint: false
            optimization_topology: false
            optimization_topology_unique: true
    node_templates:
        agent:
            type: agent
            requirements:
                - host: vm
        worker:
            type: worker
            persistent: true
            requirements:
                - host:
                      node: vm
        vm:
            type: vm
            requirements:
                - host: hypervisor
        hypervisor:
            type: hypervisor
{% endraw %}
```





## Expected Error

The following error is expected to be thrown, when resolving variability.

```text linenums="1"
The result is ambiguous considering nodes (without optimization)
```
