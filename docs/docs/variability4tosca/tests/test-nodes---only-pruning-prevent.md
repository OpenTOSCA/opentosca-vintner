# Pruning Nodes (Prevent)

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

- Node "node_three" is present even though incoming relations are not present since it declares that it can not be pruned.
- Node, that node "node_four" also has no incoming relations, however, is present since there had not been any incoming relation at all.


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_one:
      type: node_one
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - relation_two:
            node: node_three
            conditions: false
    node_two:
      type: node_two
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - relation_three: node_three
    node_three:
      type: node_three
      prunable: false
    node_four:
      type: node_four
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    node_three:
      type: node_three
    node_four:
      type: node_four
```
