# Get Variability Expression

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

Assigns "Miles" to the variable "value" of the node "container" since the variability expression "name" resolves to "Miles".

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    inputs:
      some_input:
        default:
          concat:
            - some
            - _
            - value
  node_templates:
    container:
      type: container
      properties:
        - value:
            expression:
              get_variability_input: some_input
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    container:
      type: container
      properties:
        value: some_value
```
