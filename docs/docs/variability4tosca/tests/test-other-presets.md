## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    inputs:
      mode:
        type: string
    presets:
      one:
        inputs:
          mode: one
      two:
        inputs:
          mode: two
    expressions:
      is_one:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - one
      is_two:
        equal:
          - variability_input: mode
          - two
    options:
      type_default_condition: true
  node_templates:
    one:
      type: one
      conditions:
        logic_expression: is_one
    two:
      type: two
      conditions:
        logic_expression: is_two
      requirements:
        - three: three
    three:
      type: three
```




## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service template is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    two:
      type: two
      requirements:
        - three: three
    three:
      type: three
```
