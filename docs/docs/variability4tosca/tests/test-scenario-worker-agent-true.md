# scenario-worker-agent-true

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests') }}

## Description

- agent and worker hosted on a virtual machine
- virtual machine is only present if either agent or worker is present
- worker is absent

- agent is present, thus, also the virtual machine is present


## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0
topology_template:
  variability:
    options:
      strict: false
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      conditions: true
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    worker:
      type: worker
      conditions: false
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
```



## Variability-Resolved Service Template

The following variability-resolved service templated is expected.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_3
topology_template:
  node_templates:
    agent:
      type: agent
      requirements:
        - host: vm
    vm:
      type: vm
```
