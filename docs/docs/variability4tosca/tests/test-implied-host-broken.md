# implied-host-broken

{{ autogenerated_notice('./task docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

## Description

Only one hosting relation must be present. Hence, there is a conflict between implied relations and hosting constraints.

## Variable Service Template

The variability of the following variable service template shall be resolved.

```yaml linenums="1"
tosca_definitions_version: tosca_variability_1_0_rc_2
topology_template:
  variability:
    inputs:
      l:
        type: boolean
    expressions:
      is_l:
        equal:
          - variability_input: l
          - true
      is_r:
        equal:
          - variability_input: l
          - false
  node_templates:
    application:
      type: Application
      persistent: true
      requirements:
        - host:
            node: left
            implied: true
        - host:
            node: right
            implied: true
    right:
      type: Right
      conditions:
        logic_expression: is_r
    left:
      type: Left
      conditions:
        logic_expression: is_l
```

## Variability Inputs

When resolving variability, the following variability inputs shall be used.

```yaml linenums="1"
l: true
```




## Expected Error

The following error is expected to be thrown, when resolving variability.

```text linenums="1"
Could not solve
```
