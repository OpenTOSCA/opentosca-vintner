# TOSCA Software-Defined Car (SofDCar) Profile 1.0 Release Candidate

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:sofdcar') }}

This document specifies the TOSCA Software-Defined Car (SofDCar) profile.
This profile includes normative TOSCA types for the domain of software-defined cars. 
Standardizing such normative TOSCA types improves interoperability.
For example, an ECU supplier can model and distribute the deployment and management of their ECUs using these types. 
Various OEMs can then import provided models and integrate them into their cars.
The specification is under active development and is not backwards compatible with any previous versions.


## TOSCA SofDCar Core Profile

The core normative TOSCA type definitions contain high-level type definitions which are mainly derived from the normative TOSCA type definitions of the [TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML 1.3](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html){target=_blank}.
These types mainly concern the following topics.

- ECU hardware and software
- HPC hardware and software
- Sensors and actuators
- Communication channels

Considering modeling communication, the TOSCA modeling approach is application centric meaning that, e.g., a CAN communication is modeled by relationships between the communicating software components and no CAN bus connected to the ECUs is modeled.
However, this might not provide all required information.
Therefore, we provide also a node type to model, e.g., a CAN bus.
This topic is also discussed in more detail in [TOSCA Networking](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html#_Toc26969482){target=_blank} in which they propose to have a TOSCA model for the application and a second one for the networking.

## TOSCA SofDCar Extended Profile

The extended normative TOSCA type definitions contain additional high-level type definitions which are derived from the core type definitions.
These types mainly concern specific communications, such as CAN or FlexRay, but also ECUs and HPCs, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
