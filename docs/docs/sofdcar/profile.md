# TOSCA Software-Defined Car (SofDCar) Profile 1.0 Release Candidate

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:sofdcar') }}

This document specifies the TOSCA Software-Defined Car (SofDCar) profile.
This profile includes normative TOSCA types for the domain of software-defined cars. 
Standardizing such normative TOSCA types improves interoperability.
For example, an ECU supplier can model and distribute the deployment and management of his ECUs using these types. 
Various OEMs can then import provided models and integrate them into their cars.
The specification is under active development and is not backwards compatible with any previous versions.


## Normative TOSCA Type Definitions

The normative TOSCA type definitions contain high-level type definitions which are supposed to be extended by custom types.
These types mainly concern the following topics.

- ECU hardware and software
- HPC hardware and software
- Sensors and actuators
- Communications, such as CAN, FlexRay, and Ethernet

Considering modeling communication, the TOSCA modeling approach is application centric meaning that, e.g., a CAN communication is modeled by relationships between the communicating software components and no CAN bus connected to the ECUs is modeled.
However, this might not provide all required information.
Therefore, we provide also node types to model, e.g., a CAN bus.
This topic is also discussed in more detail in [TOSCA Networking](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.3/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.3-os.html#_Toc26969482){target=_blank} in which they propose to have a TOSCA model for the application and a second one for the networking.

## Non-Normative TOSCA Type Definitions

The non-normative TOSCA type definitions contain type definitions focusing on showing how the normative types can be used to model an Arduino as ECU and an Raspberry Pi as HPC.
However, since these types are non-normative they are not required to be supported.
