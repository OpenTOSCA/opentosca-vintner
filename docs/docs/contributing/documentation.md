# Documentation

This document holds instructions on writing the documentation.

## Guidelines

We follow the following guidelines when writing documentation.

- start a document with "This document holds ..."
- use "we" instead of "you" or imperative
- use "Next, we" instead of "Then, we ...", "We then ...", etc.
- use ", see" instead of "..., as given in ...", "..., as presented in ...", etc.
- use the step-by-step guide template in `docs/templates/guide`
- use the specification template in `docs/templates/specification`
- use "as follows" instead of "in the following"


## MkDocs

{{ linux_only_notice() }}

We use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material){target=_blank} as documentation system.
The files are located in the `docs` directory.
Custom macros are implemented in `docs/macros.py` using [mkdocs-macros](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io){target=_blank}.

First, install all dependencies, such as Python, [pandoc](https://pandoc.org){target=_blank}, mkdocs, PlantUML, etc. globally on your system.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:install
```

Next, reload your session.

Next, start a local development server on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000){target=_blank}.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:serve
```

Next, open the docs in your browser.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:open
```

## Autogenerated Markdown

Some Markdown files are autogenerated, e.g., [Dependencies](../dependencies.md){target=_blank} or [Interface](../interface.md){target=_blank}.
Changes must be made in the respective template files.
Files are generated during the Release workflow and overwrite committed files.
To warn the developer, include the following custom marco at the top of the template.

```text linenums="1"
{% raw %}
{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:dependencies') }}
{% endraw %}
```

This will render the following warning, if the docs are served using `yarn docs:serve` but not when built.

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:dependencies', True) }}


## Casts

{{ linux_only_notice() }}

The docs contain recorded demos.
We use the following tools.

- [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/){target=_blank} to record a terminal session.
- [demo-magic](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic){target=_blank} to automate the terminal session.
- [asciinema-player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player){target=_blank} to embed casts in a standalone manner.

Casts are not recorded during any workflow.
The following command can be used to record the `home` cast for the landing page.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:record:home
```

A cast can be embedded using the custom macro `asciinema_player` inside a Markdown file.

```text linenums="1"
{% raw %}
{{ asciinema_player('getting-started') }}
{% endraw %}
```

This will embed the cast `docs/docs/assets/casts/getting-started.cast` inside the page as follows.

{{ asciinema_player('getting-started') }}


## Export 

{{ linux_only_notice() }}

To export _registered_ pages as PDF, run the following command. 
The PDFs are stored in `dist-docs`.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:export
```

By default, [https://vintner.opentosca.org](https://vintner.opentosca.org){target=_blank} is used.
To export pages of [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000){target=_blank}, run the following command. 

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:export:local
```


## Interface

To generate the documentation for the CLI and REST API, run the following command.
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:interface
```

## Dependencies

To generate a list of licenses for all (transitive) dependencies, run the following command
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:dependencies
```

The list includes information, such as package name, version, license, etc., and is written to a CSV file.
At the same time, the [Dependencies](../dependencies.md){target=_blank} page is generated.

## Puccini

{{ linux_only_notice() }}

We use [puccini](https://github.com/tliron/puccini) to validate a service template.
Therefore, run the following command.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn puccini:check:single path/to/service-template.yaml
```

To validate all registered service templates, run the following command.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn puccini:check
```

## PlantUML

We use [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com) for visualizing UML diagrams.
Read [PlantUML Guide](https://plantuml.com/de/guide) for modeling instructions.

The following command generates PlantUML files for registered service templates.
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.
Furthermore, [mkdocs_build_plantuml](https://github.com/quantorconsulting/mkdocs_build_plantuml){target=_blank} is used to plot PlantUML to SVGs when building the documentation.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:puml
```

Note, we use the public PlantUML server [https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml){target=_blank} for plotting SVGs.
It is also possible to start a local PlantUML server using Docker.
Therefore, run the following command.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn puml:up 
```

However, you also need to configure the following environment variables in `docs/.env`.

```yaml linenums="1"
MKDOCS_PUML_SERVER=http://localhost:8080
MKDOCS_PUML_SERVER_SSL=true
```

To stop the local PlantUML server, run the following command.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn puml:down
```

There is also a deprecated way to plot PlantUML to SVG.
Therefore, run the following command.
This considers all `.puml` files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:plot:puml
```

## Queries4TOSCA

To generate the conformance tests for Queries4TOSCA, run the following command.
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:tests:query
```

## TOSCA SofDCar Profile

To generate the TOSCA SofDCar Profile, run the following command.
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:tests:query
```

## Variability4TOSCA

To generate the conformance tests for Variability4TOSCA, run the following command.
This command is also executed during the Release workflow and overwrites committed files.

```shell linenums="1"
yarn docs:generate:tests:query
```


## Limitations

- Performance is suffering due to the heavy use of plugins.
- It is not possible to configure which release should be shown in the navigation bar. The latest release is always use which is in general correct.
