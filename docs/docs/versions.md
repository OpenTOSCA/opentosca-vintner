# Versions

This document holds information about the versioning concept of Vintner.

Vintner uses full commit hashes as version numbers.
The current version can be accessed using `vintner --version`.

Vintner is a research prototype.
There exists only a single GitHub release.
Older releases are removed when a new GitHub release is published.
Vintner versions used in publications are archived using Zenodo.

For each GitHub release, there exists a Docker Image. 
These images are not removed.

The versions used in package managers, such as npm, use semantic versioning.
