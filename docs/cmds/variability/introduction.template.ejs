# Variability4TOSCA Conformance Test Suite 1.0 Release Candidate

{{ autogenerated_notice('yarn docs:generate:tests:variability') }}

This document specifies the conformance test suite for the Variability4TOSCA specification which can be used to evaluate Variability4TOSCA implementations.
The specification is under active development and is not backwards compatible with any previous versions.

## Conformance Tests

Each test is described on a separate page.
The description includes typically a variable service template, variability inputs,
expected errors, expected variability-resolved service template and so on along with an explanation about the expected
processing.
