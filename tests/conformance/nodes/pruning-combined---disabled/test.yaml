name: Pruning Nodes (Combined)
description: |
    The following is a complex example using transient and unprunable nodes.
    The variable service topology is structured as follows.

    - A user application is hosted on a web server hosted on a virtual machine. 
    - The virtual machine is hosted on a hypervisor.
    - Furthermore, a monitoring agent is hosted on the virtual machine.

    The variability-resolved service template only contains the hypervisor.

    - The user application is not present.
    - Thus, corresponding relations are also not present. 
    - Thus, the web server and corresponding relations are not present. 
    - At this moment, the virtual machine is hosting only the monitoring agent which is transient.
    - Since the virtual machine only hosts a transient component, the virtual machine and the monitoring agent are not present.
    - The hypervisor is present even though all incoming relations are not present since the hypervisor is unprunable.
