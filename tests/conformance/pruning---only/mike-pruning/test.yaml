    - Node "source" has a relation "relation" to node "target"
    - "source-target" pruning of relations is enabled
    - "relation" pruning of nodes is enabled

    - In addition, target has a relation "another" on another node "another"
    - Moreover, node "ananother" has a relation on "another"

    - "false" is assigned to relation "relation"
    - thus, relation "relation" is removed
    - thus, node "target" is removed 
    - thus, relation "another" is removed

    - node "another" is preserved since node "ananother" has a requirement on it
