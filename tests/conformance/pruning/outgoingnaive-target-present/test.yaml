    - The node "source" has an outgoing relation "relation" to node "target". 
    - The node default condition mode "outgoingnaive" is used. 
    - Thus, there is a cycle: "source" checks if "relation" is present and "relation" checks if "source" is present. 
    - Thus, "source" and "relation" can be removed. 
    - "target" is present since it has no default condition assigned.
