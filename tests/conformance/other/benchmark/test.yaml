description: To benchmark our implementation of a Variability4TOSCA processor, we run several tests. Thereby, a service template is generated and then resolved based on a seed. A seed of value n results in 2n node templates and 2n relationship templates, thus, 4n templates. For example, a seed of 10,000 generates 20,0000 node templates and 20,0000 relationship templates. When variability is resolved, n node templates and n relationship templates are removed.
