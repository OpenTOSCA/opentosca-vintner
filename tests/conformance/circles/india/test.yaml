    - node pruning is enabled
    - relation defaults (NOT pruning) is enabled

    - since node_three is present, relation_three_one is present (condition is not overridden by pruning since relation pruning is not enabled)
    - since relation_three_one is present, node_one is present
    - since node_one is present, node_two is present, thus, relation_two_one is present
