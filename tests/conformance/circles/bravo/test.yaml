    - node and relation defaults are enabled

    - node_one checks if relation_one is present 
    - relation_one checks if node_one and node_two are present (first circle)
    - node_two checks if node_one is present (second circle)

    - node_one is present since true is assigned as condition
    - thus, node_two is present
    - thus, relation_one is present
