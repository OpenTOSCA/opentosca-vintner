    - node and relation pruning is enabled

    - node_one checks if relation_two_one or relation_three_one is present 
    - relation_two_one checks if node_one and node_two are present (first circle)
    - node_two checks if node_one is present (second circle)
    - relation_three_one checks if node_one and node_three is present (third circle)
    - node_three is absent

    - expected template is empty wrt optimization
