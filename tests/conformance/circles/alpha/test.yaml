    - node and relation defaults are enabled

    - node_one checks if relation_one is present 
    - relation_one checks if node_one and node_two are present (first circle)
    - node_two checks if node_one is present (second circle)

    - if node_one is absent, then also node_two and relation_one are absent
    - since the solution is optimized towards minimal numbers of nodes, the expected template is empty
