    - node and relation pruning is enabled

    - node_one checks if relation_one is present 
    - relation_one checks if node_one and node_two are present (first circle)
    - node_two checks if node_one is NOT present (second circle)

    - either node_one or node_two can be present
    - thus, relation_one is absent
    - thus, node_one is absent
    - thus, node_two is present


    - note, this is the same behaviour as if only node and relation defaults would have been enabled
