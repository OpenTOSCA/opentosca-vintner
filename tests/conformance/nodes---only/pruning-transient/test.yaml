name: Pruning Nodes (Transient)
description: |
    - Node and relation pruning is enabled.
    - Node "node_three" has two incoming relations whose sources are the node "node_one" and "node_two". 
    - Node "node_one" is transient and node "node_two" is not present.
    - Thus, node "node_three" is not present since only a transient node has an incoming relation.
    - Node "node_four" also has incoming relations, however, is present since there had not been any incoming relation at all.
